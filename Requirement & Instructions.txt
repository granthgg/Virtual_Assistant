Firstly, Unzip the Virtual_Assistant folder.
And the to able to run this on your system download all the contents of virtualassistant folder which include the following files:

.idea (folder)
venv (folder)
Virtualassistant.py

then some additional files to not get any error such as:

PyAudio-0.2.11-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
PyWhatKit_DB

Download all the above and save it all in one folder.

Running:
Then double click on Virtualassistant.py file to run this.
If it does not run by double clicking then you can run through IDLE , now open with IDLE an then click on Run and then Run module or F5.
Or you can also use other compiler like VScode , Pycharm, etc.

Commands:
speak "wake up" in order to start taking command from you. Until then it will keep on listening to you to say the word "wake up".
you can put this agaon on sleep by saying "wait" "sleep" "pause" and when it is in sleep then you can say "stop" or "goodbye" to close the program


After that you can give various command for various function to work.
For example,

you can have basic conversation by saying "who made you", "who are you","how are you" ,"what is my name" , "what is your name" or you can even ask "what is love".
say "wikipedia" to search from wikipedia
say "dictionary" to search any word meaning
ask about "news headlines" or "news"

And last of all, if it does not get anything it can simply search on google for you to give the result.
there might be more commands just explore the code to find out. 

Error if you encounter or if it is stuck at listening only go to code in there go to def hearMe() under that change 
                         with sr.Microphone(device_index=0) as source:

And speak little louder and clearly and avoid backgroud noise to get better recognation.
